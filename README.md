## Game Lobby

A website created using Rails for the backend ([Github](https://github.com/rj-ortega/game-lobby-api)) and React for the front end. It's features are searching for popular games by clicking on the top nav links, adding a profile, adding games to that profile and being able to categorize those games into Wishlist, Playing and Finished, as well as delete them from your profile. Once I add the functionality of searching I'll deploy the app - Stay tuned.
